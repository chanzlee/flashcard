      <ul>
        <li><h5>JavaScript (JS)</h5> <p class="initially-hidden"> An object-oriented computer programming language commonly used to create interactive effects within web browsers.</p></li>
        <li><h5>Operators</h5> <p class="initially-hidden"> JavaScript operators are used to assign values, compare values, perform arithmetic operations, and more.</p></li>
        <li><h5>Variables</h5><p class="initially-hidden"> Variables can be thought of as named containers. You can place data into these containers and then refer to the data simply by naming the container. Before you use a variable in a JavaScript program, you must declare it. Variables are declared with the var keyword as follows.</p></li>
        <li><h5>Variable naming conventions</h5><p class="initially-hidden">Essential conventions include generic patterns that should be adhered in order to write readable, consistent and maintainable code.</p></li>
        <li><h5>Functions</h5><p class="initially-hidden">Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function is a JavaScript procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.</p></li>
        <li><h5>Methods</h5><p class="initially-hidden">JavaScript methods are actions that can be performed on objects. A JavaScript method is a property containing a function definition. Property. Value. firstName.</p></li>
        <li><h5>Arguments</h5><p class="initially-hidden">The arguments object is a local variable available within all (non-arrow) functions. You can refer to a function's arguments within the function by using the arguments object. This object contains an entry for each argument passed to the function, the first entry's index starting at 0.</p></li>
        <li><h5>Parameters</h5><p class="initially-hidden">Parameters are variables listed as a part of the function definition.</p></li>
        <li><h5>Return</h5><p class="initially-hidden">In JavaScript, return statements cease execution in a function and return a value to the caller; JavaScript functions require an explicit return statement for returning the result of an expression (the value) from a function. When a return statement is not present, the interpreter automatically returns undefined.</p></li>
        <li><h5>Chaining methods</h5><p class="initially-hidden">Method chaining, also known as named parameter idiom, is a common syntax for invoking multiple method calls in object-oriented programming languages. Each method returns an object, allowing the calls to be chained together in a single statement without requiring variables to store the intermediate results.</p></li>
        <li><h5>Strings</h5><p class="initially-hidden">A JavaScript string stores a series of characters like "John Doe". A string can be any text inside double or single quotes: var carname = "Volvo XC60"; var carname = 'Volvo XC60'; String indexes are zero-based: The first character is in position 0, the second in 1, and so on.</p></li>
        <li><h5>Booleans</h5><p class="initially-hidden">A Boolean expression is a logical statement that is either TRUE or FALSE . Boolean expressions can compare data of any type as long as both parts of the expression have the same basic data type.</p></li>
        <li><h5>Undefined</h5><p class="initially-hidden">In JavaScript, undefined means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value, such as: var TestVar; alert(TestVar); //shows undefined alert(typeof TestVar); //shows undefined. null is an assignment value.</p></li>
        <li><h5>NaN</h5><p class="initially-hidden">Definition and Usage. The NaN property represents "Not-a-Number" value. This property indicates that a value is not a legal number. The NaN property is the same as the Number.Nan property. Tip: Use the isNaN() global function to check if a value is a NaN value.</p></li>
        <li><h5>Escape</h5><p class="initially-hidden">The escape() function computes a new string in which certain characters have been replaced by a hexadecimal escape sequence.</p></li>
        <li><h5>Alert</h5><p class="initially-hidden">Advertisements. JavaScript supports three important types of dialog boxes. These dialog boxes can be used to raise an alert, or to get confirmation on any input or to have a kind of input from the users.</p></li>
        <li><h5>Comments</h5><p class="initially-hidden">Creating Single Line Comments. To create a single line comment in JavaScript, you place two slashes "//" in front of the code or text you wish to have the JavaScript interpreter ignore. When you place these two slashes, all text to the right of them will be ignored, until the next line.</p></li>
        <li><h5>jQuery</h5><p class="initially-hidden">jQuery is a concise and fast JavaScript library that can be used to simplify event handling, HTML document traversing, Ajax interactions and animation for speedy website development. jQuery simplifies the HTML's client-side scripting, thus simplifying Web 2.0 applications development.</p></li>
        <li><h5>Attributes</h5><p class="initially-hidden">An attribute is another term for a field. It's typically a public constant or a public variable that can be accessed directly. In this particular case, the array in Java is actually an object and you are accessing the public constant value that represents the length of the array.</p></li>
